## Abstract

## Introduction

Investigation of causal mechanisms behind Rare Diseases (RDs) is challenging, as these disorders are nor prevalent enough to be represented in major bioinformatics resources or pathway databases. At the same time, a number of disease-focused resources are developed which could offer insights into specific rare diseases, if searched systematically. During BioHackathon'19 we benefit from an existing, rich, open source/open access infrastructure focused on disease-related mechanisms. We streamlined different tools and platforms to enable pan-resource searches for specific questions of the field of RD research. We based on use-cases defined by the clinical experts and support the search process by factoring in high-throughput data, whenever applicable.

During the BioHackathon'19, we developed a new workflow linking together tools and platforms for visual exploration and analysis of knowledge about disease mechanisms. The workflow is tailored to support identification of novel hypotheses for RDs. We focused on repositories with well-defined APIs to facilitate their integration. 

## Methods and resources

One of such tools is MINERVA platform [PMID:31074494](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074494), allowing hosting and visual exploration of curated disease maps. Another tool of choice is Hipathia platform, allowing to interpret gene expression and mutation data into perturbations of signaling pathways. We will combine these two platforms with the content-rich DisGeNET resource and with our BioKB text mining platform for identification of evidence supporting a particular RD. We will also scan the contents of publicly available disease maps and OpenTargets for potential information pieces. We will align this bioinformatics setup with available data repositories for RDs, like RD-connect, to enable data-driven search for relevant knowledge. The search and visualization of the results will be implemented using existing building blocks, including the MINERVA plugin architecture.
