    "subtitle": "(2018) doi: 10.1101/470146",
    "abstract": "Abstract How can we assess the accuracy of our decisions? Recent theoretical and empirical work suggest that confidence in one's decision is influenced by the characteristics of motor response in a preceding decisional task. In this paper we present experiment designed to test..."

    "subtitle": "(2018) doi: 10.1101/470591",
    "abstract": "Abstract A major focus of ecology is to understand and predict ecosystem function across scales. Many ecosystem functions are only measured at local scales, while their effects occur at a landscape level. Here, we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem functi..."

    "subtitle": "(2018) doi: 10.1101/470294",
    "abstract": "Abstract Evolutionary rescue can in theory help populations avoid extinction after abrupt environmental change through the rapid evolution of advantageous traits that promote population growth. However, evolutionary rescue is thought to be rare in taxa with long generation tim..."

    "abstract": "Abstract Phagosome acidification is a critical mechanism of defense in phagocytic cells, which inhibits microbes by producing a less hospitable pH that also activates microbicidal mechanisms. We analyzed the dynamic distribution of phagolysosome pH measurements after bone marr..."

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective evidence-based therapy for dystonia. However, no unequivocal predictors of therapy responses exist. We investigate whether patients optimally responding to DBS present distinct brain network organization and str..."

    "subtitle": "(2018) doi: 10.1101/470492",
    "abstract": "Abstract For exploiting terrestrial and aquatic locomotion, vertebrates must build their locomotor patterns based on an enormous amount of variables. The great number of muscles and joints, together with the constant need for sensory feedback information (e.g. proprioception),..."

    "abstract": "Abstract In order to learn efficiently, organisms must learn how to distribute their attention to the available cues. Traditionally, most experiments on attention learning have involved discrete outcomes (e.g. no food vs. one food pellet, or category A vs. category B). A basic..."
