    "abstract": "Abstract Decreased sequencing costs now allow a laboratory to investigate genomic varia-tions in hundreds or thousands of samples by resequencing or genotype-by-sequencing (GBS). Managing and exploring the large genomic variation data require programming skills. The public genotype querying databases for many species may not be frequently updated and are still lim-ited in samples. Many individual samples have unique genomic variations in either cancer or crop studies. Here we present SnpHub, a Shiny/R-based server framework for retrieving, analyzing and visualizing the large genomic variation data within a lab. After the pre-building process based on the provided VCF files and genome annotations, the local server allows users to instantly access the SNP/INDELs and annotation information by locus or gene, and for user-defined sam-ple sets, without any programming background. The users can also easily analysis and visualize the genomics variations in heatmap, phylogenetic tree, haplotype-network, or geographically, and get genomic sequences replaced by sample-specific SNPs and INDELs. SnpHub can be applied to any species, and here we provide demo-servers for wheat progenitors using the public GBS data. SnpHub and its tutorial are available as http://guoweilong.github.io/SnpHub/.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger molecule that is important in the biology of Vibrio cholerae, but the molecular mechanisms by which this molecule regulates downstream phenotypes have not been fully characterized. We have previously shown that the Vc2 c-di-GMP-binding riboswitch, encoded upstream of the gene tfoY, functions as an off-switch in response to c-di-GMP. However, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP controls expression of tfoY has not been fully elucidated. During our studies of this mechanism, we determined that c-di-GMP binding to Vc2 also controls the abundance and stability of upstream non-coding small RNAs (sRNA) with 3â€™-ends located immediately downstream of the Vc2 riboswitch. Our results suggest these sRNAs are not generated by transcriptional termination but rather by preventing degradation of the upstream untranslated RNA when c-di-GMP is bound to Vc2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Xanthomonas is one of the most important bacterial genera of plant pathogens causing economic losses in crop production worldwide. Despite its importance, many aspects of basic Xanthomonas biology remain unknown or understudied. Here, we present the first genus-wide analysis of CRISPR-Cas in Xanthomonas and describe specific aspects of its occurrence. Our results show that Xanthomonas genomes harbour subtype I-C and I-F CRISPR-Cas systems and that species belonging to distantly Xanthomonas-related genera in Xanthomonadaceae exhibit the same configuration of coexistence of the I-C and I-F CRISPR subtypes. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis using Cas proteins indicated that the CRISPR systems present in Xanthomonas spp. are the result of an ancient acquisition. Despite the close phylogeny of these systems, they present significant variation in both the number and targets of spacers. An interesting characteristic observed in this study was that the identified plasmid-targeting spacers were always driven toward plasmids found in other Xanthomonas strains, indicating that CRISPR-Cas systems could be very effective in coping with plasmidial infections. Since many effectors are plasmid encoded, CRISPR-Cas might be driving specific characteristics of plant-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ongoing and severe public health threat of viruses of the family Flaviviridae , including dengue, hepatitis C, West Nile, yellow fever, and zika, demand a greater understanding of how these viruses evolve, emerge and spread in order to respond. Central to this understanding is an updated phylogeny of the entire family. Unfortunately, most cladograms of Flaviviridae focus on specific lineages, ignore outgroups, and rely on midpoint rooting, hampering their ability to test ingroup monophyly and estimate ingroup relationships. This problem is partly due to the lack of fully annotated genomes of Flaviviridae , which has genera with slightly different gene content, hindering genome analysis without partitioning. To tackle these problems, we developed an annotation pipeline for Flaviviridae that uses a combination of ab initio and homology-based strategies. The pipeline recovered 100% of the genes in reference genomes and annotated over 97% of the expected genes in the remaining non-curated sequences. We further demonstrate that the combined analysis of genomes of all genera of Flaviviridae ( Flavivirus , Hepacivirus , Pegivirus , and Pestivirus ), as made possible by our annotation strategy, enhances the phylogenetic analyses of these viruses for all optimality criteria that we tested (parsimony, maximum likelihood, and posterior probability). The final tree sheds light on the phylogenetic relationship of viruses that are divergent from most Flaviviridae and should be reclassified, especially the soybean cyst nematode virus 5 (SbCNV-5) and the Tamana bat virus. We also corroborate the close phylogenetic relationship of dengue and zika viruses with an unprecedented degree of support.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The wheel tree (Trochodendron aralioides) is one of only two species in the basal eudicot order Trochodendrales. Together with Tetracentron sinense, the family is unique in having secondary xylem without vessel elements, long considered to be a primitive character also found in Amborella and Winteraceae. Recent studies however have shown that Trochodendraceae belong to basal eudicots and demonstrate this represents an evolutionary reversal for the group. Trochodendron aralioides is widespread in cultivation and popular for use in gardens and parks. Findings: We assembled the T. aralioides genome using a total of 679.56 Gb of clean reads that were generated using both PacBio and Illumina short-reads in combination with 10XGenomics and Hi-C data. Nineteen scaffolds corresponding to 19 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 1.614 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 73.37 Mb in addition to 1,534 contigs. Repeat sequences accounted for 64.226% of the genome, and 35,328 protein-coding genes with an average of 5.09 exons per gene were annotated using de novo, RNA-seq, and homology-based approaches. According to a phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes, T. aralioides diverged in a basal position relatively to core eudicots, approximately 121.8-125.8 million years ago. Conclusions: Trochodendron aralioides is the first chromosome-scale genome assembled in the order Trochodendrales. It represents the largest genome assembled to date in the basal eudicot grade, as well as the closest order relative to the core-eudicots, as the position of Buxales remains unresolved. This genome will support further studies of wood morphology and floral evolution, and will be an essential resource for understanding rapid changes that took place at the base of the Eudicot tree. Finally, it can serve as a valuable source to aid both the acceleration of genome-assisted improvement for cultivation and conservation efforts of the wheel tree.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The continual enigma that is sublinear scaling of the whole-body metabolic rate should be solved on both the ultimate and proximate levels. The proximate mechanism likely involves superlinear scaling of metabolically inert tissue/organ masses, sublinear scaling of metabolically expensive organ masses, a decrease in mass-specific metabolic rates or, more likely, a combination of these three things. Surprisingly, studies on the scaling of tissue/organ masses are very scarce. Here, we analyse the scaling of tissue/organ masses in a sample of 100 mammalian species with a phylogenetically informed method (PGLS). Metabolically inert adipose tissue scales isometrically, but the masses of energetically expensive visceral organs scale sublinearly, with the exception of lungs, with the lowest slope occurring for the brain. As discussed, such sublinear scaling together with the decrease in the mass-specific metabolic rate with body mass explains the sublinear scaling of the whole-body metabolic rate in both mammals and birds on the proximate level. However, in birds, the role of the decrease in the mass-specific metabolic rate seems more important.",

    "abstract": "Summary Understanding brain function requires understanding neural circuits at the level of specificity at which they operate. While recent years have seen the development of a variety of remarkable molecular tools for the study of neural circuits, their utility is currently limited by the inability to deploy them in specific elements of native neural circuits, i.e. particular neuronal subtypes. One can obtain a degree of specificity with neuron-specific promoters, but native promoters are almost never sufficiently specific restricting this approach to transgenic animals. We recently showed that one can obtain transgenic mice with augmented anatomical specificity in targeted brain regions by identifying cis- regulatory elements (i.e. enhancers) uniquely active in those brain regions and combining them with a heterologous promoter, an approach we call EDGE (Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression). Here we extend this strategy to the generation of viral (rAAV) vectors, showing that when combined with the right minimal promoter they largely recapitulate the specificity seen in the corresponding transgenic lines in wildtype animals, even of another species. Because active enhancers can be identified in any tissue sample, this approach promises to enable the kind of circuit-specific manipulations in any species. This should not only greatly enhance our understanding of brain function, but may one day even provide novel therapeutic avenues to correct the imbalances in neural circuits underlying many disorders of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many plant species worldwide are dispersed by scatterhoarding granivores: animals that hide seeds in numerous, small caches for future consumption. Yet, the evolution of scatterhoarding is difficult to explain because undefended caches are at high risk of pilferage. Previous models have attempted to solve this problem by giving cache owners unrealistically large advantages in cache recovery, by kin selection (but individuals that cache and those that pilfer are usually unrelated), or by introducing reciprocal pilferage of \"shared\" seed resources. However, the role of environmental variability has been so far overlooked in this context. One important form of such variability is masting, which is displayed by many plant species dispersed by scatterhoarders. We use a mathematical model to investigate the influence of masting on the evolution of scatter-hoarding. The model accounts for periodically varying annual seed fall, caching and pilfering behavior, and the demography of scatterhoarders. Masting, through its effects on population density, reduces cache pilferage and lowers the reproductive cost of caching (i.e. the cost of caching for the future rather than using seeds for current reproduction). These reductions promote the evolution of scatter-hoarding behavior especially when interannual variation in seed fall and the period between masting events are high.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Terraces in phylogenetic tree space are, among other things, important for the design of tree space search strategies. While the phenomenon of phylogenetic terraces is already known for unlinked partition models on partitioned phylogenomic data sets, it has not yet been studied if an analogous structure is present under linked and scaled partition models. To this end, we analyze aspects such as the log-likelihood distributions, likelihood-based significance tests, and nearest neighborhood interchanges on the trees residing on a terrace and compare their distributions among unlinked, linked, and scaled partition models. Our study shows that there exists a terrace-like structure under linked and scaled partition models as well. We denote this phenomenon as quasi-terrace. Therefore quasi-terraces should be taken into account in the design of tree search algorithms as well as when reporting results on 'the' final tree topology in empirical phylogenetic studies.",
