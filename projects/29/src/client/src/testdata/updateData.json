By using datasets from intracortical multi-electrode recordings and from large- scale electrocorticography (ECoG) grids, we investigated how parameters of visual stimulation could be extracted from the local field potential (LFP) and how this compared with the information available from multi-unit activity (MUA). MUA recorded from macaque V1 contained comparable amounts of stimulus information (orientation and motion direction) as simultaneously recorded LFP power in two frequency bands, one in the alpha-beta band and the other in the gamma band. In the ECoG array, covering a large portion of the left hemisphere, visual information was spatially limited to the recording sites in visual areas. ECoG-LFP contained most information in the same frequency bands as microelectrode-LFP. Most surprisingly, from the ECoG-LFP power in these frequency bands, we were able to decode the identity of natural scenes. The fact that information was contained in the same bands in both intracortical and ECoG recordings suggests that oscillatory activity could play similar roles at both spatial scales.",

MUA recorded from macaque V1 contained comparable amounts of stimulus information (orientation and motion direction) as simultaneously recorded LFP power in two frequency bands, one in the alpha-beta band and the other in the gamma band. In the ECoG array, covering a large portion of the left hemisphere, visual information was spatially limited to the recording sites in visual areas. ECoG-LFP contained most information in the same frequency bands as microelectrode-LFP. Most surprisingly, from the ECoG-LFP power in these frequency bands, we were able to decode the identity of natural scenes. The fact that information was contained in the same bands in both intracortical and ECoG recordings suggests that oscillatory activity could play similar roles at both spatial scales.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Suppressed recombination around a sex-determining locus allows divergence between homologous sex chromosomes and the functionality of their genes. Here, we reveal patterns of the earliest stages of sex-chromosome evolution in the diploid dioecious herb Mercurialis annua on the basis of cytological analysis, de novo genome assembly and annotation, genetic mapping, exome resequencing of natural populations, and transcriptome analysis. Both genetic mapping and exome resequencing of individuals across the species range independently identified the largest linkage group, LG1, as the sex chromosome. Although the sex chromosomes of M. annua are karyotypically homomorphic, we estimate that about a third of the Y chromosome has ceased recombining, a region containing 568 transcripts and spanning 22.3 cM in the corresponding female map. Patterns of gene expression hint at the possible role of sexually antagonistic selection in having favored suppressed recombination. In total, the genome assembly contained 34,105 expressed genes, of which 10,076 were assigned to linkage groups. There was limited evidence of Y-chromosome degeneration in terms of gene loss and pseudogenization, but sequence divergence between the X and Y copies of many sex-linked genes was higher than between M. annua and its dioecious sister species M. huetii with which it shares a sex-determining region. The Mendelian inheritance of sex in interspecific crosses, combined with the other observed pattern, suggest that the M. annua Y chromosome has at least two evolutionary strata: a small old stratum shared with M. huetii, and a more recent larger stratum that is probably unique to M. annua and that stopped recombining about one million years ago.",

Here, we reveal patterns of the earliest stages of sex-chromosome evolution in the diploid dioecious herb Mercurialis annua on the basis of cytological analysis, de novo genome assembly and annotation, genetic mapping, exome resequencing of natural populations, and transcriptome analysis. Both genetic mapping and exome resequencing of individuals across the species range independently identified the largest linkage group, LG1, as the sex chromosome. Although the sex chromosomes of M. annua are karyotypically homomorphic, we estimate that about a third of the Y chromosome has ceased recombining, a region containing 568 transcripts and spanning 22.3 cM in the corresponding female map. Patterns of gene expression hint at the possible role of sexually antagonistic selection in having favored suppressed recombination. In total, the genome assembly contained 34,105 expressed genes, of which 10,076 were assigned to linkage groups. There was limited evidence of Y-chromosome degeneration in terms of gene loss and pseudogenization, but sequence divergence between the X and Y copies of many sex-linked genes was higher than between M. annua and its dioecious sister species M. huetii with which it shares a sex-determining region. The Mendelian inheritance of sex in interspecific crosses, combined with the other observed pattern, suggest that the M. annua Y chromosome has at least two evolutionary strata: a small old stratum shared with M. huetii, and a more recent larger stratum that is probably unique to M. annua and that stopped recombining about one million years ago.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Minimally-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-time —that enables quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PET— presents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. In this paper, we present proof-of-concept in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Using normalized time-frequency analysis on temporal PA sequences, the neural activity in the seizure group was distinguished from those of the control groups. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that fPA imaging of fluorescence quenching-based VSD is a promising tool for in vivo recording of deep brain activities in the rat brain, thus excluding the need of invasive craniotomy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chromatin interactions have important roles for enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) and regulating the transcription of genes. CTCF and cohesin proteins are located at the anchors of chromatin interactions, forming their loop structures. CTCF has insulator function limiting the activity of enhancers into the loops. DNA binding sequences of CTCF indicate their orientation bias at chromatin interaction anchors - forward-reverse (FR) orientation is frequently observed. DNA binding sequences of CTCF were found in open chromatin regions at about 40% - 80% of chromatin interaction anchors in Hi-C and in situ Hi-C experimental data. Though the number of chromatin interactions was about seventy thousand in Hi-C at 50kb resolution, about twenty millions of chromatin interactions were recently identified by HiChIP at 5kb resolution. It has been reported that long range of chromatin interactions tends to include less CTCF at their anchors. It is still unclear what proteins are associated with chromatin interactions. To find DNA binding motif sequences of transcription factors (TF), such as CTCF, and repeat DNA sequences affecting the interaction between enhancers and promoters of genes and their expression, first I predicted TF bound in enhancers and promoters using DNA motif sequences of TF and experimental data of open chromatin regions in monocytes and other cell types, which were obtained from public and commercial databases. Second, transcriptional target genes of each TF were predicted based on enhancer-promoter association (EPA). EPA was shortened at the genomic locations of FR or reverse-forward (RF) orientation of DNA motif sequence of a TF, which were supposed to be at chromatin interaction anchors and acted as insulator sites like CTCF. Then, the expression levels of the transcriptional target genes predicted based on the EPA were compared with those predicted from only promoters. Total 287 biased orientation of DNA motifs (159 FR and 153 RF orientation, the reverse complement sequences of some DNA motifs were also registered in databases, so the total number was smaller than the number of FR and RF) affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes significantly in CD14+ monocytes of four people in common. The same analysis was conducted in CD4+ T cells of four people. DNA motif sequences of CTCF, cohesin and other transcription factors involved in chromatin interactions were found to be a biased orientation. Transposon sequences, which are known to be involved in insulators and enhancers, showed a biased orientation. The biased orientation of DNA motif sequences tended to be co-localized in the same open chromatin regions.

DNA binding sequences of CTCF indicate their orientation bias at chromatin interaction anchors - forward-reverse (FR) orientation is frequently observed. DNA binding sequences of CTCF were found in open chromatin regions at about 40% - 80% of chromatin interaction anchors in Hi-C and in situ Hi-C experimental data. Though the number of chromatin interactions was about seventy thousand in Hi-C at 50kb resolution, about twenty millions of chromatin interactions were recently identified by HiChIP at 5kb resolution. It has been reported that long range of chromatin interactions tends to include less CTCF at their anchors. It is still unclear what proteins are associated with chromatin interactions. To find DNA binding motif sequences of transcription factors (TF), such as CTCF, and repeat DNA sequences affecting the interaction between enhancers and promoters of genes and their expression, first I predicted TF bound in enhancers and promoters using DNA motif sequences of TF and experimental data of open chromatin regions in monocytes and other cell types, which were obtained from public and commercial databases. Second, transcriptional target genes of each TF were predicted based on enhancer-promoter association (EPA). EPA was shortened at the genomic locations of FR or reverse-forward (RF) orientation of DNA motif sequence of a TF, which were supposed to be at chromatin interaction anchors and acted as insulator sites like CTCF. Then, the expression levels of the transcriptional target genes predicted based on the EPA were compared with those predicted from only promoters. Total 287 biased orientation of DNA motifs (159 FR and 153 RF orientation, the reverse complement sequences of some DNA motifs were also registered in databases, so the total number was smaller than the number of FR and RF) affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes significantly in CD14+ monocytes of four people in common. The same analysis was conducted in CD4+ T cells of four people. DNA motif sequences of CTCF, cohesin and other transcription factors involved in chromatin interactions were found to be a biased orientation. Transposon sequences, which are known to be involved in insulators and enhancers, showed a biased orientation. The biased orientation of DNA motif sequences tended to be co-localized in the same open chromatin regions. Moreover, for 85% of FR and RF orientations of DNA motif sequences, EPI predicted from EPA that were shortened at the genomic locations of the biased orientation of DNA motif sequence were overlapped with chromatin interaction data (Hi-C and HiChIP) significantly more than other types of EPAs.|Abstract Chromatin interactions have important roles for enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) and regulating the transcription of genes.

      "abstract": "Abstract Since 2004, podcasts have emerged as a decentralised medium for science communication to the global public. However, to-date, there have been no large-scale quantitative studies of the production and dissemination of science podcasts. This study identified 952 English language science podcasts available between January and February 2018 and analysed online textual and visual data related to the podcasts to classify key production parameters. The total number of science podcast series available grew linearly between 2004 and 2010, and then exponentially between 2010 and 2018. 65% of science podcast series were hosted by scientists and 77% were targeted to public audiences. Although a wide range of primarily single-subject science podcasts series were noted, 34% of science podcast series were not dedicated to single subject. Compared to biology and physics, chemistry may be under-represented by science podcasts.

In genetic studies that analyze a large number of sequenced individuals, it is critical to detect and remove those variants with poor quality as they may cause spurious findings. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for performing quality control on variants identified from NGS data by combining a traditional filtering approach and a machine learning approach. Our method uses information on sequencing quality such as sequencing depth, genotyping quality, and GC contents to predict whether a certain variant is likely to contain errors. We applied our method to two whole-genome sequencing datasets where one dataset consists of related individuals from families while the other consists of unrelated individuals. Results indicate that our method outperforms widely used methods for performing QC on variants such as VQSR of GATK by considerably improving the quality of variants to be included in the analysis. Our approach is also very efficient, and hence can be applied to large sequencing datasets. We conclude that combining a machine learning algorithm trained with sequencing quality information and the filtering approach is an effective approach to perform quality control on genetic variants from sequencing data.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional functioning. These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing. In the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 hours of total SD and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under SD relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, the decrease in ITPC was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance in the ssVEP cognitive-emotional task, and the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) in the majority of our participants. The results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted in SD. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of SD, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with SD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional functioning. These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing. In the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 hours of total SD and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under SD relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, the decrease in ITPC was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance in the ssVEP cognitive-emotional task, and the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) in the majority of our participants. The results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted in SD. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of SD, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with SD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Multicellular development requires coordinated cell polarization relative to body axes, and translation to oriented cell division. In plants, it is unknown how cell polarities are connected to organismal axes and translated to division. Here, we identify Arabidopsis SOSEKI (SOK) proteins that integrate apical-basal and radial organismal axes to localize to polar cell edges. Localization does not depend on tissue context, requires cell wall integrity and is defined by a transferrable, protein-specific motif. SOK proteins structurally resemble the DIX oligomerization domain in the animal Dishevelled polarity regulator. The DIX-like domain self-interacts and is required for edge localization and for influencing division orientation. Our work identifies a plant compass, interpreted by SOK proteins. Furthermore, despite fundamental differences, polarity in plants and animals converge upon the same protein domain.",

However, exactly how MMR jeopardizes meiotic success is unclear. Here we utilize a combination of S. cerevisiae genetics, genome-wide mapping of recombination and computational modelling to demonstrate that MMR unexpectedly influences the global distribution of recombination through preferential suppression of interfering crossovers (COs) at regions of greater sequence divergence.

      "abstract": "Abstract Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) is an intracellular pathogen within a broad spectrum of hosts. Essential to E. piscicida virulence is its ability to survive and replicate inside host cells, yet the underlying mechanisms and the nature of the replicative compartment remain unclear. Here, we characterized its intracellular lifestyle in non-phagocytic cells and showed that intracellular replication of E. piscicida in non-phagocytic cells is dependent on its type III secretion system. Following internalization, E. piscicida is contained in vacuoles that transiently mature into early endosomes, but subsequently bypasses the classical endosome pathway and fusion with lysosomes which depends on its T3SS. Following a rapid escape from the degradative pathway, E. piscicida was found to create a specialized replication-permissive niche characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. We also found that a T3SS effector EseJ is responsible for intracellular replication of E. piscicida by preventing endosome/lysosome fusion. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that EseJ is necessary for bacterial colonization of E. piscicida in both mice and zebrafish. Thus, this work elucidates the strategies used by E. piscicida to survive and proliferate within host non-phagocytic cells.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Summary: We introduce and implement two measures for quantifying genealogical concordance in phylogenomic datasets: the gene concordance factor (gCF) and the site concordance factor (sCF). For every branch of a reference tree, gCF is defined as the percentage of decisive gene trees containing that branch. This measure is already in wide usage, but here we introduce a package that calculates it while accounting for variable taxon coverage among gene trees. sCF is a new measure defined as the percentage of decisive sites supporting a branch in the reference tree. gCF and sCF complement classical measures of branch support in phylogenetics by providing a full description of underlying disagreement among loci and sites. Availability and Implementation: An easy to use implementation and tutorial is freely available in the IQ-TREE software (http://www.iqtree.org).

For every branch of a reference tree, gCF is defined as the percentage of decisive gene trees containing that branch. This measure is already in wide usage, but here we introduce a package that calculates it while accounting for variable taxon coverage among gene trees. sCF is a new measure defined as the percentage of decisive sites supporting a branch in the reference tree. gCF and sCF complement classical measures of branch support in phylogenetics by providing a full description of underlying disagreement among loci and sites.

      "abstract": "Abstract The transmission and pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is disproportionately influenced by evolution in the five variable regions of the virus surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120). Insertions and deletions (indels) are a significant source of evolutionary change in these regions. However, the influx of indels relative to nucleotide substitutions has not yet been quantified through a comparative analysis of HIV-1 sequence data. Here we develop and report results from a phylogenetic method to estimate indel rates for the gp120 variable regions across five major subtypes and two circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of HIV-1 group M. We processed over 26,000 published HIV-1 gp120 sequences, from which we extracted 6,605 sequences for phylogenetic analysis. In brief, our method employs maximum likelihood to reconstruct phylogenies scaled in time and fits a Poisson model to the observed distribution of indels between closely related pairs of sequences in the tree (cherries). The rate estimates ranged from 3.0e-5 to 1.5e-3 indels/nt/year and varied significantly among variable regions and subtypes. Indel rates were significantly lower in the region encoding variable loop V3, and also lower for HIV-1 subtype B relative to other subtypes. We also found that variable loops V1, V2 and V4 tended to accumulate significantly longer indels. Further, we observed that the nucleotide composition of indel sequences was significantly distinct from that of the flanking sequence in HIV-1 gp120. Indels affected potential N-linked glycosylation sites substantially more often in V1 and V2 than expected by chance, which is consistent with positive selection on glycosylation patterns within these regions of gp120. These results represent the first comprehensive measures of indel rates in HIV-1 gp120 across multiple subtypes and CRFs, and identifies novel and unexpected patterns for further research in the molecular evolution of HIV-1.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The transmission and pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is disproportionately influenced by evolution in the five variable regions of the virus surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120). Insertions and deletions (indels) are a significant source of evolutionary change in these regions. However, the influx of indels relative to nucleotide substitutions has not yet been quantified through a comparative analysis of HIV-1 sequence data. Here we develop and report results from a phylogenetic method to estimate indel rates for the gp120 variable regions across five major subtypes and two circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of HIV-1 group M. We processed over 26,000 published HIV-1 gp120 sequences, from which we extracted 6,605 sequences for phylogenetic analysis. In brief, our method employs maximum likelihood to reconstruct phylogenies scaled in time and fits a Poisson model to the observed distribution of indels between closely related pairs of sequences in the tree (cherries). The rate estimates ranged from 3.0e-5 to 1.5e-3 indels/nt/year and varied significantly among variable regions and subtypes. Indel rates were significantly lower in the region encoding variable loop V3, and also lower for HIV-1 subtype B relative to other subtypes. We also found that variable loops V1, V2 and V4 tended to accumulate significantly longer indels. Further, we observed that the nucleotide composition of indel sequences was significantly distinct from that of the flanking sequence in HIV-1 gp120. Indels affected potential N-linked glycosylation sites substantially more often in V1 and V2 than expected by chance, which is consistent with positive selection on glycosylation patterns within these regions of gp120. These results represent the first comprehensive measures of indel rates in HIV-1 gp120 across multiple subtypes and CRFs, and identifies novel and unexpected patterns for further research in the molecular evolution of HIV-1.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We report the results of a three-year precision medicine study that enrolled 1190 presumed healthy participants at a single research clinic. To enable a better assessment of disease risk and improve diagnosis, a precision health platform that integrates non-invasive functional measurements and clinical tests combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) was developed. The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed: 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score higher than 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRI/MRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.",

To enable a better assessment of disease risk and improve diagnosis, a precision health platform that integrates non-invasive functional measurements and clinical tests combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) was developed. The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed: 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score higher than 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRI/MRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Social processes are associated with depression, particularly understanding and responding to others, deficits in which can manifest as callousness/unemotionality (CU). Thus, CU may reflect some of the genetic risk to depression. Further, this vulnerability likely reflects the neurological substrates of depression, presenting biomarkers to capture genetic vulnerability of depression severity. However, heritability varies within brain regions, so a high-resolution genetic perspective is needed. Method: In a sample of 258 same-sex twin pairs from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study (LTS), we developed a toolbox that maps genetic and environmental associations between brain and behavior at high resolution. We used this toolbox to estimate brain areas that are genetically associated with both depressive symptoms and CU. We then overlapped the two maps to generate coordinates that allow for tests of downstream effects of genes influencing our clusters. Results: Genetic variance influencing cortical thickness in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) sulci and gyri, ventral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), pre-somatic motor cortex (PreSMA), medial precuneus, left occipital-temporal junction (OTJ), parietal-temporal junction (PTJ), ventral somatosensory cortex (vSMA), and medial and lateral precuneus were genetically associated with both depression and CU. Split-half replication found support for both DLPFC clusters. Meta-analytic term search identified 'theory of mind', 'inhibit', and 'pain' as likely functions. Gene and transcript mapping/enrichment analyses implicated calcium channels. Conclusions: CU reflects genetic vulnerability to depression that likely involves executive and social functioning in a distributed process across the cortex. This approach works to unify neuroimaging, neuroinformatics, and genetics to discover pathways to psychiatric vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The genus Shewanella comprises a group of marine-dwelling species with worldwide distribution. Several species are regarded as causative agents of food spoilage and opportunistic pathogens of human diseases. In this study, a standard multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on six protein-coding genes (gyrA, gyrB, infB, recN, rpoA and topA) was established as a rapid and accurate identification tool in fifty-nine type Shewanella strains. This method yielded sufficient resolving power in regard to enough informative sites, adequate sequence divergences and distinct interspecies branches. The stability of phylogenetic topology was supported by high bootstrap values and concordance with different methods. The reliability of the MLSA scheme was further validated by identical phylogenies and high correlations of genomes. The MLSA approach provided a robust system to exhibit evolutionary relationships in the Shewanella genus. The split network tree proposed twelve distinct monophyletic clades with identical G+C contents and high genetic similarities. Eighty-six tested strains were investigated to explore the population biology of the Shewanella genus in China. The most prevalent Shewanella species were Shewanella algae, Shewanella xiamenensis, Shewanella chilikensis, Shewanella indica, Shewanella seohaensis and Shewanella carassii. The strains frequently isolated from clinical and food samples highlighted the importance of increasing the surveillance of Shewanella species. Combined with the genetic, genomic and phenotypic analyses, Shewanella upenei should be considered a synonym of S. algae, and Shewanella pacifica should be reclassified as a synonym of Shewanella japonica.",

The interplay between the network architecture and intrinsic motor properties clearly affects transport properties but remains poorly understood. Here, by using surface micro-patterns of actin polymerization, we investigate stochastic transport properties of colloidal beads in antiparallel networks of overlapping actin filaments. We found that 200-nm beads coated with myosin-Va motors displayed directed movements towards positions where the net polarity of the actin network vanished, accumulating there. The bead distribution was dictated by the spatial profiles of local bead velocity and diffusion coefficient, indicating that a diffusion-drift process was at work. Remarkably, beads coated with heavy mero-myosin-II motors showed a similar behavior. However, although velocity gradients were steeper with myosin II, the much larger bead diffusion observed with this motor resulted in less precise positioning. Our observations are well described by a three-state model, in which active beads locally sense the net polarity of the network by frequently detaching from and reattaching to the filaments. A stochastic sequence of processive runs and diffusive searches results in a biased random walk. The precision of bead positioning is set by the gradient of net actin polarity in the network and by the run length of the cargo in an attached state.

      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous cellular processes, including enzyme behaviour, signalling, and protein folding and transport are highly influenced by the local microviscosity environment within living cells. Molecular rotors are fluorescent molecules that respond to the viscosity of their environment through changes in both the intensity and lifetime of their fluorescence. We have synthesised a novel boron-dipyrrin (BODIPY) molecular rotor that is also a substrate for the SNAP-tag targeting system (named BG-BODIPY), allowing us to target the rotor to discrete locations within the living cell. We demonstrate that BG-BODIPY reports viscosity, and that this can be measured either through fluorescence lifetime or intensity ratiometric measurements. The relative microviscosities within the ER, Golgi, mitochondrial matrix, peroxisomes, lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm were significantly different. Additionally, this approach permitted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the absolute viscosity within both mitochondria and stress granules, showcasing BG-BODIPY's usefulness in studying both membrane bound and membraneless organelles. These results highlight targeted BG-BODIPY's broad usefulness for making measurements of cellular viscosity both with FLIM and conventional confocal microscopy, the latter option greatly extending the accessibility of the technique.",

Although the approach has been used in applied investigations, little methodological advice is available on how to design or perform a factorial Mendelian randomization analysis. Previous analyses have employed a 2x2 approach, using dichotomized genetic scores to divide the population into 4 subgroups as in a factorial randomized trial. Methods: We describe two distinct contexts for factorial Mendelian randomization: investigating interactions between risk factors, and investigating interactions between pharmacological interventions on risk factors. We propose two-stage least squares methods using all available genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, and using continuous genetic scores as instrumental variables rather than dichotomized scores. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to investigate the interaction between body mass index and alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure. Results: Simulated and real data show that efficiency is maximized using the full set of interactions between genetic variants as instruments. In the applied example, between four- and ten-fold improvement in efficiency is demonstrated over the 2x2 approach. Analyses using continuous genetic scores are more efficient than those using dichotomized scores. Efficiency is improved by finding genetic variants that divide the population at a natural break in the distribution of the risk factor, or else divide the population into more equal sized groups. Conclusions: Previous factorial Mendelian randomization analyses may have been underpowered.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Factorial Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants to answer questions about interactions. Although the approach has been used in applied investigations, little methodological advice is available on how to design or perform a factorial Mendelian randomization analysis. Previous analyses have employed a 2x2 approach, using dichotomized genetic scores to divide the population into 4 subgroups as in a factorial randomized trial. Methods: We describe two distinct contexts for factorial Mendelian randomization: investigating interactions between risk factors, and investigating interactions between pharmacological interventions on risk factors. We propose two-stage least squares methods using all available genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, and using continuous genetic scores as instrumental variables rather than dichotomized scores. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to investigate the interaction between body mass index and alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure. Results: Simulated and real data show that efficiency is maximized using the full set of interactions between genetic variants as instruments. In the applied example, between four- and ten-fold improvement in efficiency is demonstrated over the 2x2 approach. Analyses using continuous genetic scores are more efficient than those using dichotomized scores. Efficiency is improved by finding genetic variants that divide the population at a natural break in the distribution of the risk factor, or else divide the population into more equal sized groups. Conclusions: Previous factorial Mendelian randomization analyses may have been underpowered. Efficiency can be improved by using all genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, rather than the 2x2 approach.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: In newborns, severe congenital heart defects are rarer than mild ones. The reason why is unknown, but presumably related to a liability threshold that rises with the severity of a defect. Because the same genetic mutation can cause different defects, other variables may contribute to pushing an individual past a defect-specific liability threshold. We consider here how variables in the genetic architecture of a heart defect depend upon its fitness cost, as defined by the likelihood of survival to reproductive age in natural history studies. Methods: We phenotyped ~10,000 Nkx2-5+/- newborn mice, a model of human congenital heart disease, from two inbred strain crosses. Genome-wide association analyses detected loci that modify the risk of an atrial septal defect, membranous or muscular ventricular septal defect, or atrioventricular septal defect. The number of loci, heritability and quantitative effects on risk of pairwise (GxG-Nkx) and higher-order (GxGxG-Nkx) epistasis between the loci and Nkx2-5 mutation were examined as a function of the fitness cost of a defect. Results: Nkx2-5+/- mice have pleiotropic heart defects; about 70% have normal hearts. The model recapitulates the epidemiological relationship between the severity and incidence of a heart defect. Neither the number of modifier loci nor heritability depends upon the severity of a defect, but GxG-Nkx and GxGxG-Nkx effects on risk do. Interestingly, GxGxG-Nkx effects are three times more likely to suppress risk when the genotypes at the first two loci are homozygous and from the same, rather than opposite strains in a cross. Syn- and anti-homozygous genotypes at GxGxG-Nkx interactions can have an especially large impact on the risk of an atrioventricular septal defect. Conclusions: Given a modestly penetrant mutation, epistasis contributes more to the risk of severe than mild congenital heart defect. Conversely, genetic compatibility between interacting genes, as indicated by the protective effects of syn-homozygosity at GxGxG-Nkx interactions, plays a newfound role in the robustness of cardiac development. The experimental model offers practical insights into the nature of genetic risk in congenital heart disease. The results more fundamentally address a longstanding question regarding how mutational robustness could arise from natural selection.",

Neither the number of modifier loci nor heritability depends upon the severity of a defect, but GxG-Nkx and GxGxG-Nkx effects on risk do. Interestingly, GxGxG-Nkx effects are three times more likely to suppress risk when the genotypes at the first two loci are homozygous and from the same, rather than opposite strains in a cross. Syn- and anti-homozygous genotypes at GxGxG-Nkx interactions can have an especially large impact on the risk of an atrioventricular septal defect. Conclusions: Given a modestly penetrant mutation, epistasis contributes more to the risk of severe than mild congenital heart defect. Conversely, genetic compatibility between interacting genes, as indicated by the protective effects of syn-homozygosity at GxGxG-Nkx interactions, plays a newfound role in the robustness of cardiac development. The experimental model offers practical insights into the nature of genetic risk in congenital heart disease. The results more fundamentally address a longstanding question regarding how mutational robustness could arise from natural selection.",

The reason why is unknown, but presumably related to a liability threshold that rises with the severity of a defect.

      "abstract": "Abstract Quantitative assessment of antibiotic-responsive RNA transcripts holds promise for a rapid point of care (POC) diagnostic tool for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. These assays aim to distinguish susceptible and resistant isolates by transcriptional differences upon drug exposure. However, an often-overlooked dimension of designing these tests is that the genetic diversity within a species may yield differential transcriptional regulation independent of resistance phenotype. Here, we use a phylogenetically diverse panel of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and transcriptome profiling coupled with RT-qPCR to test this hypothesis, to identify azithromycin responsive transcripts and evaluate their potential diagnostic value, and to evaluate previously reported diagnostic markers for ciprofloxacin resistance (porB and rpmB). Transcriptome profiling confirmed evidence of population structure in transcriptional response to azithromycin. Taking this population structure into account, we found azithromycin-responsive transcripts overrepresented in susceptible strains compared to resistant strains, and selected four candidate diagnostic transcripts (rpsO, rplN, omp3, and NGO1079) that were the most significantly differentially regulated between phenotypes across drug exposure. RNA signatures for these markers categorically predicted resistance in 19/20 cases, with the one incorrect categorical assignment for an isolate at the threshold of reduced susceptibility. Finally, we found that porB and rpmB expression were not diagnostic of ciprofloxacin resistance in a panel of isolates with unbiased phylogenetic sampling. Overall, our results suggest that RNA signatures as a diagnostic tool are promising for future POC diagnostics; however, development and testing should consider representative genetic diversity of the target pathogen.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) follows a stereotypic progression well-characterized by Braak staging. However, some AD cases show deviations from the Braak staging scheme. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these variations in the regional distribution of tau pathology are linked to heterogeneity in the clinical phenotypes of AD. Methods: We included a clinicopathological cohort of ninety-four AD cases enriched for atypical clinical presentations. Subjects underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Main cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, language, and memory function) were assessed using an established composite z-score. We assessed NFT density and distribution from thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy throughout four neocortical and two hippocampal regions. A mathematical algorithm classifying AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing (HpSp), and limbic predominant (LP) subtypes based on regional NFT burden was compared to unbiased hierarchical clustering for cases with Braak stage > IV. Results: Patients diagnosed with logopenic primary progressive aphasia showed significantly higher NFT density in the superior temporal gyrus relative to patients diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia (p = 0.0091), while patients with corticobasal syndrome showed significantly higher NFT density in the primary motor cortex (p = 0.0205). Hierarchical clustering identified three discrete clusters of patients characterized respectively by low overall NFT burden (n = 18), high overall burden (n = 30), and cortical-predominant burden (n = 24). A regionally specific effect was observed for visuospatial ability; higher NFT density in the angular gyrus (β = -0.0921, p = 0.0099) and in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus (β = -0.0735, p = 0.0380) was significantly associated with more severe visuospatial dysfunction, modulated by age of death. Conclusions: Our results suggest domain-specific functional consequences of regional NFT accumulation. In particular, we observed focal aggregation of NFT density in clinically relevant regions among different clinical AD variants. Continued work to map the regionally specific clinical consequences of tau accumulation presents an opportunity to increase understanding of disease mechanisms underlying atypical clinical manifestations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) follows a stereotypic progression well-characterized by Braak staging. However, some AD cases show deviations from the Braak staging scheme. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these variations in the regional distribution of tau pathology are linked to heterogeneity in the clinical phenotypes of AD. Methods: We included a clinicopathological cohort of ninety-four AD cases enriched for atypical clinical presentations. Subjects underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Main cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, language, and memory function) were assessed using an established composite z-score. We assessed NFT density and distribution from thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy throughout four neocortical and two hippocampal regions. A mathematical algorithm classifying AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing (HpSp), and limbic predominant (LP) subtypes based on regional NFT burden was compared to unbiased hierarchical clustering for cases with Braak stage > IV. Results: Patients diagnosed with logopenic primary progressive aphasia showed significantly higher NFT density in the superior temporal gyrus relative to patients diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia (p = 0.0091), while patients with corticobasal syndrome showed significantly higher NFT density in the primary motor cortex (p = 0.0205). Hierarchical clustering identified three discrete clusters of patients characterized respectively by low overall NFT burden (n = 18), high overall burden (n = 30), and cortical-predominant burden (n = 24). A regionally specific effect was observed for visuospatial ability; higher NFT density in the angular gyrus (β = -0.0921, p = 0.0099) and in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus (β = -0.0735, p = 0.0380) was significantly associated with more severe visuospatial dysfunction, modulated by age of death. Conclusions: Our results suggest domain-specific functional consequences of regional NFT accumulation. In particular, we observed focal aggregation of NFT density in clinically relevant regions among different clinical AD variants. Continued work to map the regionally specific clinical consequences of tau accumulation presents an opportunity to increase understanding of disease mechanisms underlying atypical clinical manifestations.",

To gain access to the central nervous system, GBS must interact with and penetrate brain or meningeal blood vessels; however, the exact mechanisms are still being elucidated. Here, we investigate the contribution of BspC, an antigen I/II family adhesin, to the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis. Disruption of the bspC gene reduced GBS adherence to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC), while heterologous expression of BspC in non-adherent Lactococcus lactis conferred bacterial attachment. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with ΔbspC mutants exhibited lower mortality as well as decreased brain bacterial counts and inflammatory infiltrate compared with mice infected with WT GBS strains. Further, BspC was both necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine expression. We determined that BspC interacts with the host cytoskeleton component vimentin, and confirmed this interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid assay, immunofluorescent staining, and imaging flow cytometry. Vimentin null mice were protected from WT GBS infection and also exhibited less inflammatory cytokine production in brain tissue.

      "abstract": "Abstract Although acute melioidosis is the most common outcome of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, we have documented a case, P314, where the disease severity lessened with time, and the pathogen evolved towards a commensal relationship with the host. In the current study, we used whole-genome sequencing to monitor this chronic infection to better understand B. pseudomallei persistence in P314s sputum despite intense and repeated therapeutic regimens. We collected and sequenced 118 B. pseudomallei isolates from P314s airways over a >16-year period, and also sampled the patients home environment, recovering six closely related B. pseudomallei isolates from water. Using comparative genomics, we identified 126 SNPs in the core genome of the 124 isolates or 162 SNPs/indels when the accessory genome was included. The core SNPs were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, which demonstrated a close relationship between environmental and clinical isolates and detailed within-host evolutionary patterns. The phylogeny had little homoplasy, consistent with a single clonal population. Repeated sampling revealed evidence of genetic diversification, but frequent extinctions left only one successful lineage through the first four years and two lineages after that, resulting in a highly linear topology. Although these extinctions and persistence could be explained by genetic drift, we observe phenotypic changes consistent with in situ adaptation. Using a mouse model, P314 isolates caused greatly reduced morbidity and mortality compared to the environmental isolates. Additionally, potentially adaptive phenotypes changed with time and included differences in the O-antigen, capsular polysaccharide, motility, and colony morphology. The >13-year co-existence of two long-lived lineages presents interesting hypotheses that can be tested in future studies to provide additional insights into selective pressures, niche differentiation, and microbial adaptation. This unusual melioidosis case presents a rare example of the evolutionary progression to commensalism by a highly virulent pathogen within a single human host.",

Here, the MinION nanopore, long-read sequencer was used to simultaneously sequence the entire chromosome and plasmids of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Bareilly and Escherichia coli O157:H7. A rapid, random sequencing approach, coupled with de novo genome assembly within a customized data analysis workflow, that can resolve highly-repetitive genomic regions, was developed. In sequencing runs, as short as four hours, using nanopore data alone, full-length genomes were obtained with an average identity of 99.87% for Salmonella Bareilly and 99.89% for E. coli in comparison to the respective MiSeq references. These long-read assemblies provided information on serotype, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes. Using a custom-developed, SNP-selection workflow, the potential of the nanopore-only assemblies (after only 30 minutes of sequencing) for rapid phylogenetic inference, with identical topology compared to the published dataset, was demonstrated. To achieve maximum quality assemblies, the developed bioinformatics workflow employed additional polishing steps to correct the systematic errors produced by the nanopore-only assemblies. Nanopore sequencing provided a shorter (10 hours library preparation and sequencing) turnaround time compared to other NGS technologies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Cryptosporidium is an emerging opportunistic zoonotic pathogen that causes diarrheal illness in a wide range of hosts including livestock and humans. Globally there is an exponential increase in livestock production to meet the world demand for animal protein as well as for financial reasons. However, there is raised concern of the public health threat due to contamination of the environment by livestock waste carrying zoonotic pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. This study set out to establish the prevalence of Cryptosporidium as well as the circulating genotypes in order to elucidate the potential role of cattle in the spread of human cryptosporidiosis. We collected rectal coprological samples from 363 cattle in 11 households in Kiruhura district, Southwestern Uganda. The samples were screened for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using the phenol auramine staining method followed by fluorescent microscopy. DNA was then extracted from the microscopy positive samples and the COWP gene amplified using PCR. Amplified gene products were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Results: The overall animal level prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 7.7% (95% CI: 5.1-10.9), and herd level prevalence was 33.3% (95% CI: 18.5-52.2). We found a statistically significant difference (p=0.02) between infection in bulls as compared to cows. There was however no significant difference in the prevalence among the different cattle breeds sampled, with the following prevalence observed in Crosses 9.2%, Ankole 5.7%, Friesian 7.1%, and Boran 2.8% respectively. The COWP gene was successfully amplified from 20 of the 28 microscopy positive samples. All the sequenced DNA amplicons were confirmed to be C. hominis, with 98%-100% identity to sequences in the GenBank. C. hominis was the only genotype isolated from this study, further asserting that cattle could be a potential high-risk source of human cryptosporidiosis. Conclusion: This study represents the first time naturally occurring C. hominis has been isolated from cattle in Uganda. This further provides evidence of cattle possibly being biological reservoirs for C. hominis and cattle could be a potential high-risk source of human cryptosporidiosis.

To determine whether plant defense genes are activated under multiple biotic stimuli, we combined a high-throughput RNA-Seq with insect survey data on 19 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana growing on the field site of Switzerland. We found that genes with GO annotations 'glucosinolate biosynthetic process' and 'response to insects' were the most significantly enriched, exhibiting largely variable expression among plant accessions. Nearly half of the total expression variation in glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, AOP s, ESM1 , ESP , and TGG1 , was explained by among-accession variance. Combined with the field RNA-Seq data, bioassays confirmed that AOP3 was up-regulated in response to the mustard aphid Lipaphis erysimi. In addition, we also found that the expression of a major cis-jasmone activated gene CYP81D11 was positively correlated with the number of the flea beetles Phyllotreta spp. The combined results from RNA-Seq and insect surveys suggested that plants can activate their defenses even when they are exposed to multiple biotic stimuli in natura.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Although survival rates for patients with localized breast cancer have increased, patients with metastatic breast cancer still have poor prognosis. Understanding key factors involved in promoting breast cancer metastasis is imperative for better treatments. In this study, we investigated the role of syndecan-1 (Sdc1) in breast cancer metastasis. Methods: To assess the role of Sdc1 in breast cancer metastasis, we silenced Sdc1 expression in the triple-negative breast cancer human MDA-MB-231 cell line and overexpressed it in the mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cell line. Intracardiac injections were performed in an experimental mouse metastasis model using both cell lines. In vitro transwell blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain section adhesion assays were utilized to specifically investigate how Sdc1 promotes brain metastasis. A cytokine array was performed to evaluate differences in the breast cancer cell secretome when Sdc1 was silenced. Results: Silencing expression of Sdc1 in breast cancer cells significantly reduced metastasis to the brain. Conversely, overexpression of Sdc1 increased metastasis to the brain. We found that the reduction in brain metastases with Sdc1 knockdown was likely due to reduced breast cancer cell migration across the BBB and adhesion to the perivascular regions of the brain. However, there was no change in attachment to brain endothelial cells or astrocytes. Loss of Sdc1 also led to changes in breast cancer cell-secreted cytokines, which may influence the BBB. Conclusions: Taken together, our study demonstrates a role for Sdc1 in promoting breast cancer metastasis to the brain. These findings suggest that Sdc1 supports breast cancer cell migration across the BBB through regulation of cytokines, which may modulate the BBB. Further elucidating this mechanism will allow for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat brain metastasis.",

A cytokine array was performed to evaluate differences in the breast cancer cell secretome when Sdc1 was silenced. Results: Silencing expression of Sdc1 in breast cancer cells significantly reduced metastasis to the brain. Conversely, overexpression of Sdc1 increased metastasis to the brain. We found that the reduction in brain metastases with Sdc1 knockdown was likely due to reduced breast cancer cell migration across the BBB and adhesion to the perivascular regions of the brain. However, there was no change in attachment to brain endothelial cells or astrocytes. Loss of Sdc1 also led to changes in breast cancer cell-secreted cytokines, which may influence the BBB. Conclusions: Taken together, our study demonstrates a role for Sdc1 in promoting breast cancer metastasis to the brain. These findings suggest that Sdc1 supports breast cancer cell migration across the BBB through regulation of cytokines, which may modulate the BBB. Further elucidating this mechanism will allow for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat brain metastasis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, is the predominant cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Disease control is predicated on a robust innate immune response during the early stages of infection. Double-stranded RNA intermediates generated during viral genome replication are recognised by host innate immune sensors in the cytoplasm, activating the strongly antiviral interferon gene programme. Ifit proteins, which are highly expressed during the interferon response, have been shown to directly inhibit viral protein synthesis as well as regulate innate immune signalling pathways. Ifit1 is well-characterised to inhibit viral translation by sequestration of eukaryotic initiation factors or by directly binding to the 5' terminus of foreign RNA, particularly those with non-self cap structures. However, noroviruses have a viral protein, VPg, covalently linked to the 5' end of the genomic RNA, which acts as a cap substitute to recruit the translation initiation machinery. Methods: Ifit1 knockout RAW264.7 murine macrophage-like cells were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. These cells were analysed for their ability to support murine norovirus infection, determined by virus yield, and respond to different immune stimuli, assayed by quantitative PCR. The effect of Ifit proteins on norovirus translation was also tested in vitro. Results: Here, we show that VPg-dependent translation is completely refractory Ifit1-mediated translation inhibition in vitro and Ifit1 cannot bind the 5' end of VPg-linked RNA. Nevertheless, knockout of Ifit1 promoted viral replication in murine norovirus infected cells. We then demonstrate that Ifit1 promoted interferon-beta expression following transfection of synthetic double-stranded RNA, but had little effect on toll-like receptor 3 and 4 signalling. Conclusions: Ifit1 is an antiviral factor during norovirus infection but cannot directly inhibit viral translation. Instead, Ifit1 stimulates the antiviral state following cytoplasmic RNA sensing, contributing to restriction of norovirus replication.|Abstract Background Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, is the predominant cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide.

Furthermore, ongoing concerns regarding the use of mammalian sourced heparins, primarily due to prion diseases and religious beliefs, hinder the deployment of alternative heparin based therapeutics. A marine-derived, heparan sulphate-containing glycosaminoglycan extract isolated from the crab Portunus pelagicus, was identified to inhibit human BACE1 with comparable bioactivity to that of mammalian heparin (IC 50 = 1.85 ug/mL (R 2 = 0.94) and 2.43 ug/mL (R 2 = 0.93), respectively) possessing highly attenuated anticoagulant activities. The results from several structural techniques suggest that the interactions between BACE1 and the extract from P. pelagicus are complex and distinct from those of heparin.|Abstract Therapeutic options for Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, are currently restricted to palliative treatments. The glycosaminoglycan heparin, widely used as a clinical anticoagulant, has previously been shown to inhibit the Alzheimer’s disease-relevant β-secretase 1 (BACE1). Despite this, the deployment of pharmaceutical heparin for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is largely precluded by its potent anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, ongoing concerns regarding the use of mammalian sourced heparins, primarily due to prion diseases and religious beliefs, hinder the deployment of alternative heparin based therapeutics. A marine-derived, heparan sulphate-containing glycosaminoglycan extract isolated from the crab Portunus pelagicus , was identified to inhibit human BACE1 with comparable bioactivity to that of mammalian heparin (IC 50 = 1.85 μg.mL -1 (R 2 = 0.94) and 2.43 μg.mL -1 (R 2 = 0.93), respectively) possessing highly attenuated anticoagulant activities. The results from several structural techniques suggest that the interactions between BACE1 and the extract from P. pelagicus are complex and distinct from those of heparin.",

However, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP controls expression of tfoY has not been fully elucidated.

      "abstract": "Abstract As next generation sequencing (NGS) and liquid biopsy become more prevalent in clinical and research area, especially cancer diagnosis, targeted therapy guidance and disease surveillance, there is an increasing need for better methods to reduce cost and to improve sensitivity and specificity. Since the error rate of NGS is around 1%, it is difficult to identify mutations with frequency lower than 1% accurately and efficiently because of low Signal-to- Noise Ratio (SNR). Here we propose a likelihood-based approach, low-frequency mutation detector (LFMD), combining the advantages of duplex sequencing (DS) and bottleneck sequencing system (BotSeqS) to maximize utilization of duplicate sequenced reads. Compared with DS, the new method achieves higher sensitivity (improved ~16%), higher specificity (improved ~1%) and lower cost (reduced ~70%) without involving additional experimental steps, customized adapters and molecular tags. In addition, this method can also be used to improve sensitivity and specificity of other variant calling algorithms by replacing a step in traditional NGS analysis: removing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplication. Thus, LFMD can be a promising method used in genomic research and clinical fields.|Abstract As next-generation sequencing (NGS) and liquid biopsy become more prevalent in clinic and research, for cancer diagnosis, molecular target identification, and disease monitoring, there is an increasing need for better methods to reduce cost and improve sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection.

Compared with the existing state-of-the-art method DS, our method achieves higher sensitivity (improved by ~16%), comparable specificity (< 4 x 10−10 errors per base sequenced) and lower cost (reduced by ~70%) without involving additional experimental steps, customized adapters or molecular tags. LFMD is useful in areas where high precision is required, such as drug resistance prediction and cancer screening.

      "abstract": "Abstract Madagascar's biodiversity is notoriously threatened by deforestation and climate change. Many of these organisms are rare, cryptic, and severely threatened, making population-level sampling unrealistic. Such is the case with Madagascar's dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus), the only obligate hibernator within the primates. We here apply comparative genomic approaches to generate the first genome-wide estimates of genetic diversity within species of Cheirogaleus. We generate a reference genome for the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius, and use this resource to facilitate analyses of high-coverage (~30x) genomes for wild-caught individuals representing four dwarf lemur species: Cheirogaleus sp. cf. medius, C. major, C. crossleyi and C. sibreei. This study therefore represents the largest contribution to date of novel genomic resources for Madagascar's lemurs. We show that phylogenetic relationships among the four lineages of Cheirogaleus demonstrate broad-scale concordance across the genome, and yet we detect a number of discordant genomic regions. Using the size distribution of introgressed regions, we estimate that admixture, and subsequent introgression, occurred between species an average of 4.1 Mya. Introgressed regions contain genes associated with hibernation, though most significantly, show over-represented gene ontology categories relating to transcription. Finally, we estimate levels of heterozygosity and find particularly low levels in an individual sampled from an isolated population of C. medius that we refer to as C. sp. cf. medius. Our study highlights the power of comparative genomic analysis for identifying species and populations of conservation concern, as well as for illuminating possible mechanisms of adaptive phenotypic evolution - in this case, hibernation.",

The ancestral strain of B. subtilis also encodes an additional sigma factor homolog, ZpdN, not found in lab strains due to it being encoded on the large, low copy number plasmid pBS32 that was lost during domestication. DNA damage triggers pBS32 hyper-replication and cell death in a manner that depends on ZpdN but how ZpdN mediates these effects was unknown. Here we show that ZpdN is a bona fide sigma factor that can direct RNA polymerase to transcribe ZpdN-dependent genes and we rename ZpdN to SigN accordingly. Rend-seq analysis was used to determine the SigN regulon on pBS32, and the 5′ ends of transcripts were used to predict the SigN consensus sequence. Finally, we characterize the regulation of SigN itself, and show that it is transcribed by at least three promoters: P sigN1 , a strong SigA-dependent LexA-repressed promoter, P sigN2 , a weak SigA-dependent constitutive promoter, and P sigN3 , a SigN-dependent promoter. Thus, in response to DNA damage LexA is derepressed, SigN is expressed and then experiences positive feedback. How cells die in a pBS32-dependent manner remains unknown, but we predict that death is the product of expressing one or more genes in the SigN regulon.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is growing attention surrounding hospital acquired infections (HAIs) due to high associated healthcare costs, compounded by the scourge of widespread multi-antibiotic resistance. Although hospital environment disinfection is well acknowledged to be key for infection control, an understanding of colonization patterns and resistome profiles of environment-dwelling microbes is currently lacking. We report the first extensive genomic characterization of microbiomes (355), common HAI-associated microbes (891) and transmissible drug resistance cassettes (1435) in a tertiary hospital environment based on a 2-timepoint sampling of 179 sites from 45 beds. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing unveiled two distinct ecological niches of microbes and antibiotic resistance genes characterized by biofilm-forming and human microbiome influenced environments that display corresponding patterns of divergence over space and time. To study common nosocomial pathogens that were typically present at low abundances, a combination of culture enrichment and long-read nanopore sequencing was used to obtain thousands of high contiguity genomes (2347) and closed plasmids (5910), a significant fraction of which (>58%) are not represented in current sequence databases. These high-quality assemblies and metadata enabled a rich characterization of resistance gene combinations, plasmid architectures, and the dynamic nature of hospital environment resistomes and their reservoirs. Phylogenetic analysis identified multidrug resistant clonal strains as being more widely disseminated and stably colonizing across hospital sites. Further genomic comparisons with clinical isolates across multiple species supports the hypothesis that multidrug resistant strains can persist in the hospital environment for extended periods (>8 years) to opportunistically infect patients. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing antibiotic resistance reservoirs in the hospital environment and establishes the feasibility of systematic genomic surveys to help target resources more efficiently for preventing HAIs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: The wheel tree (Trochodendron aralioides) is one of only two species in the basal eudicot order Trochodendrales. Together with Tetracentron sinense, the family is unique in having secondary xylem without vessel elements, long considered to be a primitive character also found in Amborella and Winteraceae. Recent studies however have shown that Trochodendraceae belong to basal eudicots and demonstrate this represents an evolutionary reversal for the group. Trochodendron aralioides is widespread in cultivation and popular for use in gardens and parks. Findings: We assembled the T. aralioides genome using a total of 679.56 Gb of clean reads that were generated using both PacBio and Illumina short-reads in combination with 10XGenomics and Hi-C data. Nineteen scaffolds corresponding to 19 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 1.614 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 73.37 Mb in addition to 1,534 contigs. Repeat sequences accounted for 64.226% of the genome, and 35,328 protein-coding genes with an average of 5.09 exons per gene were annotated using de novo, RNA-seq, and homology-based approaches. According to a phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes, T. aralioides diverged in a basal position relatively to core eudicots, approximately 121.8-125.8 million years ago. Conclusions: Trochodendron aralioides is the first chromosome-scale genome assembled in the order Trochodendrales. It represents the largest genome assembled to date in the basal eudicot grade, as well as the closest order relative to the core-eudicots, as the position of Buxales remains unresolved. This genome will support further studies of wood morphology and floral evolution, and will be an essential resource for understanding rapid changes that took place at the base of the Eudicot tree. Finally, it can serve as a valuable source to aid both the acceleration of genome-assisted improvement for cultivation and conservation efforts of the wheel tree.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: A major goal of phylogenetic systematics is to understand both the patterns of diversification and the processes by which these patterns are formed. Few studies have focused on the ancient, species-rich Magnoliales clade and its diversification pattern. Within Magnoliales, the pantropically distributed Annonaceae are by far the most genus-rich and species-rich family-level clade, with c. 110 genera and c. 2,400 species. We investigated the diversification patterns across Annonaceae and identified traits that show varied associations with diversification rates using a time-calibrated phylogeny of 835 species (34.6% sampling) and 11,211 aligned bases from eight regions of the plastid genome (rbcL, matK, ndhF, psbA-trnH, trnL-F, atpB-rbcL, trnS-G, and ycf1). Two hypotheses that might explain patterns of diversification--the 'museum model' and heterogeneous diversification rates--are also evaluated. Results: Twelve rate shifts were identified using BAMM: in Annona, Artabotrys, Asimina, Drepananthus, Duguetia, Goniothalamus, Guatteria, Uvaria, Xylopia, the tribes Miliuseae and Malmeeae, and the Desmos-Dasymaschalon-Friesodielsia-Monanthotaxis clade (which collectively account for over 80% of the total species richness in the family). TurboMEDUSA and method-of-moments estimator analyses showed largely congruent results. A positive relationship between species richness and diversification rate is revealed using PGLS. We further explore the possible role of selected traits (habit, pollinator trapping, floral sex expression, pollen dispersal unit, anther septation, and seed dispersal unit) in shaping diversification patterns, based on inferences of BiSSE, MuSSE, HiSSE, and FiSSE analyses. Our results suggest that the liana habit, the presence of circadian pollinator trapping, androdioecy, and the dispersal of seeds as single-seeded monocarp fragments are closely correlated with higher diversification rates; pollen aggregation and anther septation, in contrast, are associated with lower diversification rates. Conclusion: Our results show that the high species richness in Annonaceae is likely the result of recent increased diversification rather than the steady accumulation of species via the 'museum model'. BAMM, turboMEDUSA, and the method-of-moments estimator all indicate heterogeneity in diversification rates across the phylogeny, with different traits associated with shifts in diversification rates in different Annonaceae clades.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Clostridium perfringens is a major enteric pathogen known to cause gastroenteritis in human adults. Although major outbreak cases are frequently reported, limited Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) based studies have been performed to understand the genomic epidemiology and virulence gene content of C. perfringens-associated outbreak strains. We performed both genomic and phylogenetic analysis on 109 C. perfringens strains (human and food) isolated from disease cases in England and Wales between 2011-2017. Initial findings highlighted the enhanced discriminatory power of WGS in profiling outbreak C. perfringens strains, when compared to the current Public Health England referencing laboratory technique of Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (fAFLP). Further analysis identified that isogenic C. perfringens strains were associated with nine distinct care home-associated outbreaks over the course of a 5-year interval, indicating a potential common source linked to these outbreaks or transmission over time and space. As expected the enterotoxin CPE gene was encoded in all but 4 isolates (96.4%; 105/109), with virulence plasmids encoding cpe (particularly pCPF5603- and pCPF4969-family plasmids) extensively distributed (82.6%;90/109). Genes encoding accessory virulence factors, such as beta-2 toxin, were commonly detected (46.7%; 50/109), and genes encoding phage proteins were also frequently identified, with additional analysis indicating their contribution to increased virulence determinants within the genomes of gastroenteritis-associated C. perfringens. Overall this large-scale genomic study of gastroenteritis-associated C. perfringens suggested that 3 major sub-types underlie these outbreaks: strains carrying (1) pCPF5603 plasmid, (2) pCPF4969 plasmid, and (3) strains carrying cpe on transposable element Tn5565 (usually integrated into chromosome). Our findings indicate that further studies will be required to fully probe this enteric pathogen, particularly in relation to developing intervention and prevention strategies to reduce food poisoning disease burden in vulnerable patients, such as the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that are fundamental to transcription and regulation of gene expression. Each TF may regulate multiple genes and each gene may be regulated by multiple TFs. TFs can act as either activator or repressor of gene expression. This complex network of interactions between TFs and genes underlies many developmental and biological processes and is implicated in several human diseases such as cancer. Hence deciphering the network of TF-gene interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression) is an important step toward understanding the regulatory pathways that underlie complex traits. There are many experimental, computational, and manually curated databases of TF-gene interactions. In particular, high-throughput ChIP-seq datasets provide a large-scale map or transcriptional regulatory interactions. However, these interactions are not annotated with information on context and mode of regulation. Such information is crucial to gain a global picture of gene regulatory mechanisms and can aid in developing machine learning models for applications such as biomarker discovery, prediction of response to therapy, and precision medicine. In this work, we introduce a text-mining system to annotate ChIP-seq derived interaction with such meta data through mining PubMed articles. We evaluate the performance of our system using the gold standard small scale manually curated TRUSST database. Our results show that the method is able to accurately extract mode of regulation with F-score 0.77 on TRRUST curated interaction and F-score 0.96 on intersection of TRUSST and ChIP-network.

      "abstract": "Abstract The ongoing and severe public health threat of viruses of the family Flaviviridae , including dengue, hepatitis C, West Nile, yellow fever, and zika, demand a greater understanding of how these viruses evolve, emerge and spread in order to respond. Central to this understanding is an updated phylogeny of the entire family. Unfortunately, most cladograms of Flaviviridae focus on specific lineages, ignore outgroups, and rely on midpoint rooting, hampering their ability to test ingroup monophyly and estimate ingroup relationships. This problem is partly due to the lack of fully annotated genomes of Flaviviridae , which has genera with slightly different gene content, hindering genome analysis without partitioning. To tackle these problems, we developed an annotation pipeline for Flaviviridae that uses a combination of ab initio and homology-based strategies. The pipeline recovered 100% of the genes in reference genomes and annotated over 97% of the expected genes in the remaining non-curated sequences. We further demonstrate that the combined analysis of genomes of all genera of Flaviviridae ( Flavivirus , Hepacivirus , Pegivirus , and Pestivirus ), as made possible by our annotation strategy, enhances the phylogenetic analyses of these viruses for all optimality criteria that we tested (parsimony, maximum likelihood, and posterior probability). The final tree sheds light on the phylogenetic relationship of viruses that are divergent from most Flaviviridae and should be reclassified, especially the soybean cyst nematode virus 5 (SbCNV-5) and the Tamana bat virus. We also corroborate the close phylogenetic relationship of dengue and zika viruses with an unprecedented degree of support.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is circumstantial evidence that, under neurodegenerative conditions, peptides deriving from aggregated or misfolded brain proteins elicit adaptive immune responses. On another hand, several genes involved in familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases were found to exert key innate immune functions. However, whether or not such observations are causally linked remains unknown. To start addressing this issue, we followed a systems biology strategy based on the mining of large proteomics, genomics and immunopeptidomics databases. First, we retrieved at the mRNA and protein levels the expression patterns of common neurodegeneration-associated genes in two professional antigen-presenting cells, namely B-cells and dendritic cells. Surprisingly, we found that under physiological conditions, numerous neurodegeneration-associated proteins are abundantly expressed by human B-cells. Moreover, a survey of the human proteome allowed us to map a unique protein-protein interaction network linking common neurodegeneration-associated proteins and their first shell interactors in human B-cells. Network connectivity analysis identified two major hubs that both relate with inflammation and autophagy: the neurodegeneration-associated protein SQSTM1 (Sequestosome-1) and the signaling molecule TRAF6 (TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6). Interestingly, the mapped network also comprised two hub proteins involved in both inflammation and autoimmunity: HSPA8 (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 also known as HSC70) and HSP90AA1 (Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class A Member 1). Finally, we explored the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB-AR) and found that a large share of neurodegeneration-associated proteins provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B-cells. For several neurodegeneration-associated proteins such as amyloid beta A4 protein, sequestosome-1 and profilin-1, the reported MHC class II restrictions of derived peptides covered multiple MHC class II alleles. In contrast, a limited set of neurodegeneration-associated proteins appeared to provide B-cell endogenous peptides whose binding properties are restricted to specific MHC class II alleles. This is notably the case for microtubule-associated protein tau, presenilin 2 and serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 from which derived peptides were exclusively reported to bind HLA-DR15, a recently-identified susceptibility gene for late onset Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, our work indicates that immunization against neurodegeneration-associated proteins might be a physiological process which is shaped, at least in part, by B-cells.",

Moreover, we show that flight impairments activate and induce structural plasticity in specific projection neurons to support increases in sleep over days.

      "abstract": "Abstract Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been used extensively to investigate the brain areas that are recruited during the Tower of London (ToL) task. Nevertheless, little research has been devoted to study the neural correlates of the ToL task using a network approach. Here we investigated the association between functional connectivity and network topology during resting-state fMRI and ToL task performance, that was performed outside the scanner. Sixty-two (62) healthy subjects (21-74 years) underwent eyes-closed rsfMRI and performed the task on a laptop. We studied global (whole-brain) and within subnetwork resting-state topology as well as functional connectivity between subnetworks, with a focus on the default-mode, fronto-parietal and dorsal and ventral attention networks. Efficiency and clustering coefficient were calculated to measure network integration and segregation, respectively, at both the global and subnetwork level. Our main finding was that higher global efficiency was associated with slower performance (β = .22, Pbca = .04) and this association seemed mainly driven by inter-individual differences in default-mode network connectivity. The reported results were independent from age, sex, education-level and motion. Although this finding is contrary to earlier findings on general cognition, we tentatively hypothesize that the reported association may indicate that individuals with a more integrated brain during the resting-state are less able to further increase network efficiency when transitioning from a rest to task state, leading to slower responses. This study also adds to a growing body of literature supporting a central role for the default-mode network in individual differences in cognitive performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria typically occur either as free-swimming planktonic cells or within a sessile, biofilm mode of growth. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the transition between these lifestyles is known to be modulated by the intracellular secondary messenger cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP). We are interested in the control of distinct biofilm-relevant phenotypes in P. aeruginosa through the modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP. Here, we characterise motility and associated biofilm formation and dispersal in two pairs of related multi-domain proteins with putative c-di-GMP turnover domains, selected to contain additional PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) homology domains known for their ability to process environmental stimuli. The enzymes PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072 have distinct functions despite their similar domain structures. The Δ rbdA deletion mutant showed significantly increased biofilm formation while biofilm formation was impaired in Δ PA2072 . Using a GFP transcriptional reporter fused to the cyclic di-GMP-responsive cdrA promoter, we show correlation between biofilm phenotype and c-di-GMP levels. Both proteins are shown to play a role in nitric oxide (NO) induced biofilm dispersal. We further studied pseudo-enzymes of similar architecture. PA5017 (DipA) is an inactive cyclase, and PA4959 (FimX) is described here as an inactive cyclase/phosphodiesterase. Loss of swimming and twitching motilities, respectively, is observed in deletion variants, which correlated with NO-induced biofilm dispersal phenotypes, as Δ dipA dispersed less well while Δ fimX dispersed better than wild type. The study highlights how Pseudomonas differentiates c-di-GMP output — in this case motility — using structurally very similar proteins and underlines a significant role for pseudo-enzymes in motility regulation and associated biofilm dispersal.",

While the genomic targets of Cry selection and the mutations that produce resistant phenotypes are known in other lepidopteran species, little is known about how Cry proteins shape the genome of H. zea. We scanned the genomes of Cry1Ac-selected and unselected H. zea lines, and identified eleven genes on six scaffolds that showed evidence of selection by Cry1Ac, including cadherin-86C (cad-86C), a gene from a family that is involved in Cry1A resistance in other lepidopterans. Although this gene was expressed in the H. zea larval midgut, the protein it encodes has only 17 to 22% identity with cadherin proteins from other species previously reported to be involved in Bt resistance. An analysis of midgut-expressed cDNAs showed significant between-line differences in the frequencies of putative nonsynonymous substitutions (both SNPs and indels). Our results indicate that cad-86C is a target of Cry1Ac selection in H. zea.

      "abstract": "Abstract Transgenic corn and cotton produce crystalline (Cry) proteins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that are toxic to lepidopteran larvae. Helicoverpa zea, a key pest of corn and cotton in the U.S., has evolved widespread resistance to these proteins produced in Bt corn and cotton. While the genomic targets of Cry selection and the mutations that produce resistant phenotypes are known in other lepidopteran species, little is known about how Cry proteins shape the genome of H. zea. We scanned the genomes of Cry1Ac-selected and unselected H. zea lines, and identified eleven genes on six scaffolds that showed evidence of selection by Cry1Ac, including cadherin-86C (cad-86C), a gene from a family that is involved in Cry1A resistance in other lepidopterans. Although this gene was expressed in the H. zea larval midgut, the protein it encodes has only 17 to 22% identity with cadherin proteins from other species previously reported to be involved in Bt resistance. An analysis of midgut-expressed cDNAs showed significant between-line differences in the frequencies of putative nonsynonymous substitutions (both SNPs and indels). Our results indicate that cad-86C is a target of Cry1Ac selection in H. zea. Future work should investigate phenotypic effects of these nonsynonymous substitutions and their impact on phenotypic resistance in field populations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that natural populations of dozens of species have undergone adaptive evolution in order to better tolerate the novel environmental conditions in urban areas. Invariably, studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas examine a single or few--often correlated--traits at a time from populations residing only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats, and do not control for environment-of-origin (e.g., maternal provisioning) effects. Thus, whether urbanization is driving divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the degree of local urbanization remains unclear. To examine whether urbanization drives clinal multivariate trait divergence, we generated seed families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, and used them to measure multiple phenotypic traits in a common garden.

      "abstract": "Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that natural populations of dozens of species have undergone adaptive evolution in order to better tolerate the novel environmental conditions in urban areas. Invariably, studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas examine a single or few--often correlated--traits at a time from populations residing only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats, and do not control for environment-of-origin (e.g., maternal provisioning) effects. Thus, whether urbanization is driving divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the degree of local urbanization remains unclear. To examine whether urbanization drives clinal multivariate trait divergence, we generated seed families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, and used them to measure multiple phenotypic traits in a common garden. Our results show that families whose parents were collected from the most urban populations grew larger, had larger flower petals, experienced delayed germination and flowering, had thinner stolons, had reduced cyanogenesis, and were more attractive to pollinators. Each of these traits together exhibited genetically-based changes that varied with the degree of urbanization of the source population. Field observations indicate that the pollinator community exhibits almost complete turnover between urban and nonurban sites, which potentially explains some of the observed divergence in reproductive traits. Our results suggest that urban populations are rapidly tuning their phenotypes to tolerate the local disturbances imposed by humans.",

Finally, we apply SINATRA to a dataset of mandibular molars from four different genera of primates and demonstrate the ability to identify unique morphological properties that summarize phylogeny.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Escherichia coli ST131 is a major cause of infection with extensive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) facilitated by widespread beta-lactam antibiotic use. This drug pressure has driven extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene acquisition and evolution in pathogens, so a clearer resolution of ST131's origin, adaptation and spread is essential. E. coli ST131's ESBL genes are typically embedded in mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that aid transfer to new plasmid or chromosomal locations, which are mobilised further by plasmid conjugation and recombination, resulting in a flexible ESBL, MGE and plasmid composition with a conserved core genome. We used population genomics to trace the evolution of AMR in ST131 more precisely by extracting all available high-quality Illumina HiSeq read libraries to investigate 4,071 globally-sourced genomes, the largest ST131 collection examined so far. We applied rigorous quality-control, genome de novo assembly and ESBL gene screening to resolve ST131's population structure across three genetically distinct Clades (A, B, C) and abundant subclades from the dominant Clade C. We reconstructed their evolutionary relationships across the core and accessory genomes using published reference genomes, long read assemblies and k-mer-based methods to contextualise pangenome diversity. The three main C subclades have co-circulated globally at relatively stable frequencies over time, suggesting attaining an equilibrium after their origin and initial rapid spread. This contrasted with their ESBL genes, which had stronger patterns across time, geography and subclade, and were located at distinct locations across the chromosomes and plasmids between isolates. Within the three C subclades, the core and accessory genome diversity levels were not correlated due to plasmid and MGE activity, unlike patterns between the three main clades, A, B and C. This population genomic study highlights the dynamic nature of the accessory genomes in ST131, suggesting that surveillance should anticipate genetically variable outbreaks with broader antibiotic resistance levels. Our findings emphasise the potential of evolutionary pangenomics to improve our understanding of AMR gene transfer, adaptation and transmission to discover accessory genome changes linked to novel subtypes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Metagenomic studies have claimed the existence of novel lineages with unprecedented properties never before observed in prokaryotes. Such lineages include Asgard archaea, which are claimed to represent archaea with eukaryotic cell complexity, and the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), a novel domain level taxon erected solely on the basis of metagenomic data. However, it has escaped the attention of most biologists that these metagenomic sequences are not assembled into genomes by sequence overlap, as for cultured archaea and bacteria. Instead, short contigs are sorted into computer files by a process called binning in which they receive taxonomic assignment on the basis of sequence properties like GC content, dinucleotide frequencies, and stoichiometric co-occurrence across samples. Consequently, they are not genome sequences as we know them, reflecting the gene content of real organisms. Rather they are metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Debates that Asgard data are contaminated with individual eukaryotic sequences are overshadowed by the more pressing issue that no evidence exists to indicate that any sequences in binned Asgard MAGs actually stem from the same chromosome, as opposed to simply stemming from the same environment. Here we show that Asgard and CPR MAGs fail spectacularly to meet the most basic phylogenetic criterion fulfilled by genome sequences of all cultured prokaryotes investigated to date: the ribosomal proteins of Asgard and CPR MAGs do not share common evolutionary histories. Their phylogenetic behavior is anomalous to a degree never observed with genomes of real organisms. CPR and Asgard MAGs are binning artefacts, assembled from environments where up to 90% of the DNA is from dead cells. Asgard and CPR MAGs are unnatural constructs, genome-like patchworks of genes that have been stitched together into computer files by binning.",

Instead, short contigs are sorted into computer files by a process called binning in which they receive taxonomic assignment on the basis of sequence properties like GC content, dinucleotide frequencies, and stoichiometric co-occurrence across samples. Consequently, they are not genome sequences as we know them, reflecting the gene content of real organisms. Rather they are metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Debates that Asgard data are contaminated with individual eukaryotic sequences are overshadowed by the more pressing issue that no evidence exists to indicate that any sequences in binned Asgard MAGs actually stem from the same chromosome, as opposed to simply stemming from the same environment. Here we show that Asgard and CPR MAGs fail spectacularly to meet the most basic phylogenetic criterion fulfilled by genome sequences of all cultured prokaryotes investigated to date: the ribosomal proteins of Asgard and CPR MAGs do not share common evolutionary histories. Their phylogenetic behavior is anomalous to a degree never observed with genomes of real organisms. CPR and Asgard MAGs are binning artefacts, assembled from environments where up to 90% of the DNA is from dead cells. Asgard and CPR MAGs are unnatural constructs, genome-like patchworks of genes that have been stitched together into computer files by binning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Hepatitis B represents a major global health problem. Despite the high endemicity of hepatitis B in Sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the molecular characteristics of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Africa, and there are very few published studies that describe the genetic characteristics of HBV in asymptomatic adults in DRC. The present study aimed at determining the molecular diversity of chronic HBV infection in voluntary blood donors in Kinshasa, DRC. Methods: Blood samples from 582 voluntary blood donors at the National Blood Transfusion Centre in Kinshasa, DRC, were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Partial amplification and sequencing of S gene in HBV-positive samples was conducted. Results: The presence of HBsAg was detected in 6.9 % (40/582) blood donors. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S gene nucleotide sequences of HBV showed that the majority (66.7 %, 10/15) of HBV strains clustered into genotype A, followed by the genotypes E (26.6 %, 4/15) and D (6.7 %, 1/15). Genotype A strains were classified into subgenotype A1, quasi-subgenotype A3, and subgenotype A4, with quasi-subgenotype A3 being predominant. One new genotype A strain did not cluster with any existing HBV/A subgenotype or quasi-subgenotype. Conclusions: The present study highlights the high genetic variability of chronic HBV infection in DRC, and the possibility of a new HBV/A subgenotype, suggesting that HBV has a long evolutionary history in DRC. Further molecular characterization of complete HBV genomes is needed for a more accurate assessment of HBV genetic variability and its clinical significance in DRC, as partial sequences are not appropriate for determining HBV new subgenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Hepatitis B represents a major global health problem. Despite the high endemicity of hepatitis B in Sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the molecular characteristics of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Africa, and there are very few published studies that describe the genetic characteristics of HBV in asymptomatic adults in DRC. The present study aimed at determining the molecular diversity of chronic HBV infection in voluntary blood donors in Kinshasa, DRC. Methods: Blood samples from 582 voluntary blood donors at the National Blood Transfusion Centre in Kinshasa, DRC, were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Partial amplification and sequencing of S gene in HBV-positive samples was conducted. Results: The presence of HBsAg was detected in 6.9 % (40/582) blood donors. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S gene nucleotide sequences of HBV showed that the majority (66.7 %, 10/15) of HBV strains clustered into genotype A, followed by the genotypes E (26.6 %, 4/15) and D (6.7 %, 1/15). Genotype A strains were classified into subgenotype A1, quasi-subgenotype A3, and subgenotype A4, with quasi-subgenotype A3 being predominant. One new genotype A strain did not cluster with any existing HBV/A subgenotype or quasi-subgenotype. Conclusions: The present study highlights the high genetic variability of chronic HBV infection in DRC, and the possibility of a new HBV/A subgenotype, suggesting that HBV has a long evolutionary history in DRC. Further molecular characterization of complete HBV genomes is needed for a more accurate assessment of HBV genetic variability and its clinical significance in DRC, as partial sequences are not appropriate for determining HBV new subgenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the underlying molecular mechanism of unloading-induced bone loss has been broadly elucidated, the pathophysiological role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this process is unknown. Here, we identified a novel lncRNA, OGRU, a 1816-nucleotide transcript with significantly decreased levels in bone specimens from hindlimb-unloaded mice and in MC3T3-E1 cells under clinorotation unloading conditions. OGRU overexpression promoted osteoblast activity and matrix mineralization under normal loading conditions and attenuated the suppression of MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation induced by clinorotation unloading. Furthermore, this study found that supplementation of pcDNA3.1(+)-OGRU via (DSS)6-liposome delivery to the bone formation surfaces of hindlimb-unloaded (HLU) mice partially alleviated unloading-induced bone loss. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that OGRU can function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to facilitate the protein expression of Hoxa10 by competitively binding miR-320-3p and subsequently promote osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Taken together, the results of our study provide the first clarification of the role of the lncRNA OGRU in unloading-induced bone loss through the miR-320-3p/Hoxa10 axis, suggesting an efficient anabolic strategy for osteoporosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The opportunistic pathogens Burkholderia cepacia and Burkholderia contaminans, both genomovars of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), are frequently cultured from the potable water system (PWS) of the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we sequenced the genomes and conducted phenotypic assays to characterize these Burkholderia isolates. All recovered isolates of the two species fall within monophyletic clades based on phylogenomic trees of conserved single-copy core genes. Within species, the ISS PWS strains all demonstrate greater than 99% average nucleotide identity (ANI), suggesting that they are of a highly similar genomic lineage and both individually may have stemmed from the two founding clonal strains before diverging into two unique sub strain populations. No evidence for horizontal gene transfer between the populations was observed. Differences between the recovered isolates can be observed at the pangenomic level, particularly within putative plasmids identified within the B. cepacia group. Phenotypically, the ISS-derived B. cepacia isolates generally exhibit a trend of lower rates and shorter duration of macrophage intracellularization compared to the selected terrestrial reference strain (though not significantly), and significantly lower rates of cellular lysis in 7 of the 19 isolates. ISS-derived B. contaminans isolates displayed no difference in rates of macrophage intracellularization compared to the selected reference, though generally increased rates lysis, with 2 of the 5 significantly increased at 12-hours post inoculation. We additionally find that ISS-isolated B. contaminans display hemolytic activity at 37°C not demonstrated by the terrestrial control, and greater antifungal capacity in the more recently collected isolates. Thankfully, the ISS-derived isolates generally exhibit 1-4 times greater sensitivity to common antibiotics used in their clinical treatments.

      "abstract": "Abstract The telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) is essential for genome stability and performs this role through the addition of repetitive DNA to the ends of chromosomes. The telomerase enzyme is composed of a reverse transcriptase (TERT), which utilizes a template domain in an RNA subunit (TER)to reiteratively add telomeric DNA at the ends of chromosomes. Multiple TERs have been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we combine a phylogenetic and biochemical approach to understand how the telomerase RNP has evolved in Brassicaceae, the family that includes A. thaliana. Because of the complex phylogenetic pattern of template domain loss and alteration at the previously characterized A. thaliana TER loci,TER1 and TER2, across the plant family Brassicaceae, we bred double mutants from plants with a template deletion at AtTER1 and T-DNA insertion at AtTER2. These double mutants exhibited no telomere length deficiency, a definitive indication that neither of these loci encode a functional telomerase RNA. Moreover, we determined that the telomerase components TERT,Dyskerin, and the KU heterodimer are under strong purifying selection, consistent with the idea that the TER with which they interact is also conserved. To test this hypothesis further, we analyzed the substrate specificity of telomerase from species across Brassicaceae and determined that telomerase from close relatives bind and extend substrates in a similar manner, supporting the idea that TERs in different species are highly similar to one another and are likely encoded from an orthologous locus. Lastly, TERT proteins from across Brassicaceae were able to complement loss of function tert mutants in vivo, indicating TERTs from other species have the ability to recognize the native TER of A. thaliana. Finally, we immunoprecipitated the telomerase complex and identified associated RNAs via RNA-seq. Using our evolutionary data we constrained our analyses to conserved RNAs within Brassicaceae that contained a template domain. These analyses revealed a highly expressed locus whose disruption by a T-DNA resulted in a telomeric phenotype similar to the loss of other telomerase core proteins, indicating that the RNA has an important function in telomere maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aims: Aquatic and terrestrial realms display stark differences in key environmental factors and phylogenetic composition. Despite such differences, their consequences for the evolution of species life history strategies remain poorly understood. Here, we examine whether and how life history strategies vary between terrestrial and aquatic species. Location: Global. Time period: Variable, the earliest year being in 1906 and the most recent in 2015. Major taxa studies: Macroscopic animals and plants species. Methods: We use demographic information for 638 terrestrial and 117 aquatic animal and plant species, to derive key life history traits capturing their population turnover, and investments in survival, development, and reproduction. We use phylogenetically corrected least squares regression to explore the differences in the trade-offs between life history traits in both realms. We then quantify the life history strategies of aquatic and terrestrial species using a phylogenetically corrected principal component analysis. Results: We find that the same trade-offs structure terrestrial and aquatic life histories, resulting in two dominant axes of variation describing species pace-of-life and reproductive spread through time. Life history strategies differ between aquatic and terrestrial environments, with phylogenetic relationships playing a minor role. We show that adaptations of plants and animals to terrestrial environments have resulted in different life history strategies, particularly with their reproductive mode and longevity. Terrestrial plants display a great diversity of life history strategies, including the species with the longest lifespans. Aquatic animals, on the contrary, exhibit higher reproductive frequency than terrestrial animals, likely due to reproductive adaptations (i.e. internal fecundation) of the later to land. Main conclusions: Our findings show that aquatic and terrestrial species are ruled by the same life history principles, but have evolved different strategies due to distinct selection pressures. Such contrasting life history strategies have important consequences for the conservation and management of aquatic and terrestrial species.",

However, the underlying mechanism and physiological relevance of such high and stable concentrations of ATP remain unclear. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adenylate kinase (ADK) cooperate to maintain cellular ATP level regardless of glucose concentrations. Single cell imaging of ATP revealed that ATP concentrations in these mutants underwent stochastic and transient depletion of ATP repeatedly, inducing formation of cytotoxic aggregation of endogenous proteins and pathogenic proteins such as huntingtin and α-synuclein. Moreover, pharmacological elevation of ATP level in an ATP-reduced mutant prevented accumulation of α-synuclein aggregation and its cytotoxicity. Removal of the cytotoxic aggregates depends on proteasome, and proteasomal activity cooperates with AMPK or ADK to resist proteotoxic stresses. Our findings provided the first evidence that cellular ATP homeostasis ensures proteostasis and revealed that stochastic fluctuation of cellular ATP concentration could contribute for cytotoxic protein aggregation, implying that AMPK and ADK are important factors that prevent proteinopathy such as neurodegenerative diseases.|Abstract ATP is the main source of chemical energy in all life and is maintained at several millimolar in eukaryotic cells.

While the phenomenon of phylogenetic terraces is already known for unlinked partition models on partitioned phylogenomic data sets, it has not yet been studied if an analogous structure is present under linked and scaled partition models. To this end, we analyze aspects such as the log-likelihood distributions, likelihood-based significance tests, and nearest neighborhood interchanges on the trees residing on a terrace and compare their distributions among unlinked, linked, and scaled partition models. Our study shows that there exists a terrace-like structure under linked and scaled partition models as well. We denote this phenomenon as quasi-terrace. Therefore quasi-terraces should be taken into account in the design of tree search algorithms as well as when reporting results on 'the' final tree topology in empirical phylogenetic studies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Plasmodium simium, a malaria parasite of non-human primates in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil was recently shown to cause zoonotic infection in humans in the region. Phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome sequences of six P. simium isolates infecting humans and two isolates from brown howler monkeys revealed that P. simium is monophyletic within the broader diversity of South American Plasmodium vivax, consistent with the hypothesis that P. simium first infected non-human primates as a result of a host-switch from humans carrying P. vivax. We provide molecular evidence that the current zoonotic infections of people have likely resulted from multiple independent host switches, each seeded from a different monkey infection. Very low levels of genetic diversity within P. simium genomes and the absence of P. simium-P. vivax hybrids suggest that the P. simium population emerged recently and has subsequently experienced a period of independent evolution in Platyrrhini monkeys. We further find that Plasmodium Interspersed Repeat (PIR) genes, Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Subtelomeric (PHIST) genes and Tryptophan-Rich Antigens (TRAg) genes in P. siumium are genetically divergent from P. vivax and are enriched for non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, consistent with the rapid evolution of these genes. Analysis of genes involved in erythrocyte invasion revealed several notable differences between P. vivax and P. simium, including large deletions within the coding region of the Duffy Binding Protein 1 (DBP1) and Reticulocyte Binding Protein 2a (RBP2a) genes in P. simium. Genotyping of P. simium isolates from non-human primates (NHPs) and zoonotic human infections showed that a precise deletion of 38 amino acids in DBP1 is exclusively present in all human infecting isolates, whereas non-human primate infecting isolates were polymorphic for the deletion. We speculate that these deletions in the parasite-encoded key erythrocyte invasion ligands and the additional rapid genetic changes have facilitated zoonotic transfer to humans. Non-human primate malaria parasites can be considered a reservoir of potential infectious human parasites that must be considered in any attempt of malaria elimination. The genome of P. simium will thus form an important basis for future functional characterizations on the mechanisms underlying malaria zoonosis.",

Genotyping of P. simium isolates from non-human primates (NHPs) and zoonotic human infections showed that a precise deletion of 38 amino acids in DBP1 is exclusively present in all human infecting isolates, whereas non-human primate infecting isolates were polymorphic for the deletion. We speculate that these deletions in the parasite-encoded key erythrocyte invasion ligands and the additional rapid genetic changes have facilitated zoonotic transfer to humans. Non-human primate malaria parasites can be considered a reservoir of potential infectious human parasites that must be considered in any attempt of malaria elimination. The genome of P. simium will thus form an important basis for future functional characterizations on the mechanisms underlying malaria zoonosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Because the evolution of modern humans from early mammals has been a continuous process, human genetic diversity at the molecular level should reflect mammalian genetic diversity. To test this prediction, we contrasted the proportion of segregating sites, q, in human data from the 1000 Genome Project with phylogenetic trees of genes in 96 mammalian genomes ranging from human to platypus. The evolvability of a gene in the human population was found to be positively correlated with the long-term molecular evolutionary rate (r = 0.592). Further analysis of human singleton and de novo mutations suggested that natural selection begins shaping intraspecies genetic diversity soon after a mutation's initial appearance. By introducing the rate of molecular evolution as a predictor of q, species-specific selection on genes can be detected as deviations from predicted values. We analyzed the average deviations of 10,173 disease-related gene sets and detected 33 gene sets likely to be under human species-specific selection. Among them, nine gene sets were related, with highly significant and positive t-values, to substance-related disorders, thus indicating that the accelerated evolution of the natural reward pathway is the most representative adaptation in humans. Eight gene sets were significantly related, with negative t-values, to infectious diseases. This result may reflect co-evolution between pathogens and humans or recent bottlenecks in the human population caused by pandemic infectious diseases. Our findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of this population genomics approach that incorporates the rates of long-term molecular evolution as predictors.",
